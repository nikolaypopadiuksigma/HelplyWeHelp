**Helply** is a mobile app that allows users (people in need) to send a help request, and from another side, allows helpers (volunteers) contribute and run users errands.

In **Helply** you just ask for the help and wait until local volunteer will contact you. You don’t even need to type your request — just use a voice message and describe details of your request.

Volunteers have a map of the local area with all requests posted on it. When a request is taken volunteer is able to contact the host and change the status of the request accordingly. App will not forget to remind everyone about safety measures such as safe distance and hands-free deliveries approach.

App also will give everyone the ability to share public feedback that will help to improve future contacts and make them safer. It is as simple as a rideshare app.
